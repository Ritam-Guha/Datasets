# This repo will contain datasets in standard convenient formats and some codes to properly extract them

***Note: I feel a lot of time is wasted because the data present online are often not formatted properly. So, preprocessing data requires a huge percentage of time in most of the projects. This is my attempt to make data more convenient to use so that preprocessing requirements are reduced drastically. I will feel more than happy if other researchers come forward and contribute in making data standardized to reduce the time requirement for preprocessing.*** 

### There are two types of datasets in this repo:

* Raw - These are datasets in raw formats (Like images, audio etc.)
* Feature engineered - These datasets contain informative features extracted from the raw datasets.

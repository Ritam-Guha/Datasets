# This repo will only contain datasets in standard convenient formats 

***Note: I feel a lot of time is wasted because the data present online are often not formatted properly. So, preprocessing data requires a huge percentage of time in most of the projects. This is my attempt to make data more convenient to use so that preprocessing requirements get decreased.I will feel more than happy if other researchers come forward and contribute in making data standardized to reduce the time requirement for preprocessing.*** 

### There are two types of datasets in this repo:

* Raw - These are datasets in raw formats (Like images, audio etc.)
* Feature engineered - These datasets contain informative features extracted from the raw datasets.
